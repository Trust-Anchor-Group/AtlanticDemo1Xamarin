# Neuro-Access Xamarin App

The **Neuro-Access Xamarin App** is a scaled down version of the [TAG ID App](https://github.com/Trust-Anchor-Group/IdApp) focusing
on helping the user get safe access to online (or physical) resources. The app is provided by
[Trust Anchor Group](https://trustanchorgroup.com/) (**TAG** for short), and is written in C#, on the Xamarin platform. The
solution contains both an Android and an iOS version of the App.

The app is built with .NET Standard 2.0 and Xamarin.Forms 5.0 (Shell), and relies on nugets from the [IoTGateway](https://github.com/PeterWaher/IoTGateway) 
framework to perform tasks related to communication and persistence.

The ID App is also published to [Google Play Store][] (for Android devices) and [Apple App Store][] (for iOS devices).
